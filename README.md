# stepheneades.com
My simplistic personal domain that directs visitors to everything related to my work and personal projects.

## Overview
From this site, visitors can find links to my social media accounts, Github, and personal site. 
Additonally, various methods of contacting me are available.

## Setup
I used a template by HTML5 UP (html5up.net | @ajlkn). I removed the overlay and made minor adjustments to the animations and responsiveness, as well as added a full background image and more icons. I update the site annually. View my old website at https://github.com/stephen-eades/stepheneades.com-old

## Usage
The site acts as a digital directory, providing hyperlinks to external sites.
